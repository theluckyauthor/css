# CSS Training

Although CSS syntax may be quite simple and easy to catch, it may get a lot of practice to achieve decent UI when built from scratch.

This repo offers 3 challenges for you to style:

 - A basic form, which contents are related to a videogame account creation
 - A simple text, extracted from: https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3280677 written by Kate Matsudaira
 - A minimalistic landing page, where you gotta match the pattern on the image, extracted from: https://dribbble.com/shots/3367317-Universitet-Modules uploaded by Slava Kornilov

 Challenge solutions will be on 'results' branch, try not to check it unless you are geniunely stuck

 Happy styling!
