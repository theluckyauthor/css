    <h1>How to Get Things Done When You Don't Feel Like It</h1>
    <h2>Five strategies for pushing through</h2>
    <h3>Kate Matsudaira</h3>
    <p>
      Have you ever come into work, sat down at your computer to begin a project, opened your editor, and then just
      stared at the screen? This happens to me all the time, so I understand your struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if you love your job, you don't always feel like doing it every day. There are so many factors that
      influence your ability to show up to work with enthusiasm and then work hard all day long.
    </p>
    <p>
      External events can take priority in your mind—family struggles, a breakup, a sick pet—and make it hard to focus.
      Then, of course, there are the struggles at work that can make it hard to feel motivated. Getting a bad review
      can knock you off course. Likewise, if you work really hard on a project and your manager doesn't seem to value
      it at all, you might wonder why you are working so hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other times you have to work on tasks you don't enjoy (for me that is writing lots of tests, or documentation) or
      projects that aren't challenging. If your work is uninteresting or if a task you've been assigned seems beneath
      your ability, finding your motivation can be hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, what do you do? Many people turn to procrastination or ignoring the task—but that only postpones the
      inevitable. You can try to talk your way out of the assignment, and maybe your manager will support you, but at
      some point the work needs to get done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since this happens to me quite often, I have captured five of my best strategies for turning out amazing work
      even when I don't feel like it.
    </p>
    <h4>Gamify your process</h4>
    <p>I discovered that if I made the process of getting started easier, those first few steps on a daunting project
      became more tenable. Once I took a few steps, it was so much easier to keep going.</p>

    <p>
      My solution was to approach a project by turning it into as many tiny steps as possible. That way I could get a
      few really easy wins under my belt. For example, each step would be a task such as "Search for ______ on Google"
      or "Have a conversation with ______." Crossing things off your to-do list gives your brain a happy little
      dopamine hit, even if the tasks are tiny—it keeps your motivation up and your excuses down.
    </p>

    <p>Try breaking your next project into the smallest increments you possibly can. Each step should be really small
      (I try for tasks that take 15 minutes or less) and really easy to accomplish, so that you can get a win!</p>
    <p>You have to overcome inertia. Little wins add up and make it easier to do that.</p>


    <h4>
      Reserve calendar time for every project
    </h4>

    <p>Set aside time on your calendar specifically for working on a task you're having trouble starting. Treat it as
      seriously as you would any other appointment. You must show up and you must work on that project.</p>
    <p>Reserve an amount of time that is realistic for making progress—at least 30 minutes to an hour. This strategy is
      key for busy people or managers. If you don't schedule the time to do meaningful strategic work, your time will
      fill up with tactical tasks.</p>
    <p>And what if you don't feel like working on the task at the appointed time? Set a timer when you're starting
      work. Set it for 10 minutes and tell yourself you have to work only until the timer goes off.</p>
    <p>Start working on the list of tiny steps you have created for yourself: google something; set up your project;
      send one email; review one document.</p>
    <p>Almost always, taking one or two of these tiny steps will get your brain working, and it will be easier to keep
      going. You'll do one task, cross it off the list, and then do another. Your timer for 10 minutes will go off, and
      you'll just keep going because now you're engaged with the project.</p>
    <p>If you're really not engaged with it after 10 minutes (though this rarely happens to me), then let yourself take
      a break. But block off another chunk of time on your calendar to come back to it soon.</p>

    <h4>
      Get other people involved
    </h4>

    <p>Sometimes the best way to get yourself to do something is to make yourself accountable to another person.</p>
    <p>According to a study by the American Society of Training and Development,1 people who commit to someone else
      have a 65 percent chance of accomplishing the goals they set. That number goes up to 95 percent if you commit to
      a specific accountability appointment with that person.</p>
    <p>Our brains are wired not to want to let down other people. If someone invests in you by agreeing to help you
      accomplish your goal, you are driven to do your part by a desire to live up to that commitment.</p>
    <p>There are a few ways to do this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Set deadlines with your manager for when certain aspects of the project will be complete, and schedule
        regular check-ins on status.</li>
      <li>Ask for help on a part of the project. With the help of another person to reduce your workload, you can get
        other parts of the project done. Set a time to meet with your helper to combine your results.</li>
      <li>Make a recurring date with a peer to work together. For example, if you are both tasked with running a series
        of tedious tests that you both would rather put off, set a time to sit together and get them done.</li>
      <li>Embrace the scrum part of Agile and have daily standups with your teammates.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Delegating work can be especially helpful when you have a really big project in front of you. Sometimes the
      scope of a project is so overwhelming that it is hard to get started; if you can solicit help from your team to
      tackle
      some of the project, then you can focus your efforts on a more manageable workload.</p>
